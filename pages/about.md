I'm a Graduate Researcher in Mechanical Engineering, advised by Dr. Kumar Vemaganti at the University of Cincinnati ([Vemaganti Research Group](http://vemaganti.com)). My research is focused on Uncertainty Quantification in Solid Mechanics, an area that is highly computational and involves multiple disciplines of study including Bayesian Statistics, Mechanical Engineering and Scientific Computing.

I earned my Masters (M.S.) in Mechanical Engineering in 2016 from the University of Kansas, where my research was in the area of Computational Fluid Mechanics.

Research Interests: Solid Mechanics, Uncertainty Quantification, Machine Learning, Scientific Computing, Numerical Analysis, Fluid Mechanics
