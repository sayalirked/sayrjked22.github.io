I'm a doctoral (Ph.D.) candidate in Mechanical Engineering, advised by Dr. Kumar Vemaganti at the University of Cincinnati ([Vemaganti Research Group](http://vemaganti.com)). My research is focused on uncertainty quantification in solid mechanics, an area that is highly computational and involves multiple disciplines of study including Bayesian Statistics, Mechanical Engineering and Scientific Computing.

I earned my Masters (M.S.) in Mechanical Engineering in 2016 from the University of Kansas, where my research was in the area of computational fluid mechanics.

Research Interests: Solid Mechanics, Uncertainty Quantification, Finite Element Modeling, High Performance Computing, Fluid Mechanics
