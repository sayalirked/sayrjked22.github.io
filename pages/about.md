I'm a Graduate Researcher in Mechanical Engineering, advised by [Dr. Kumar Vemaganti](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/vemagaks) at the University of Cincinnati ([Vemaganti Research Group](http://vemaganti.com)). My research is focused on "Bayesian learning in solid mechanics", an area that is highly computational and involves multiple disciplines of study including Bayesian Statistics, Mechanical Engineering and Scientific Computing.

I earned my Masters (M.S.) in Mechanical Engineering in 2016 from the University of Kansas, where my research was in the area of Computational Fluid Mechanics.

Research Interests: Solid Mechanics, Uncertainty Quantification, Machine Learning, Scientific Computing, Numerical Analysis, Fluid Mechanics

I like to travel and share my experiences. You can read about some of my trips at my [Travel Photography Blog](http://sayalikedari.blogspot.com/).
