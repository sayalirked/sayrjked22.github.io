I'm a doctoral (Ph.D.) candidate in Mechanical Engineering, advised by Dr. Kumar Vemaganti at the University of Cincinnati ([Vemaganti Research Group](http://vemaganti.com)). My research focus is Uncertainty Quantification in Soft-tissue Mechanics. My work is highly computational and is right at the intersection of Applied Statistics, Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.

I received my Master in Science (M.S.) in Mechanical Engineering in 2016 from the University of Kansas, where my research focus was on Computational Fluid Mechanics.

Research Interests:Solid Mechanics, Uncertainty Quantification, Finite Element Modeling, High Performance Computing, Fluid Mechanics
